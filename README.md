# Dirichlet
Dirichlet estimation and statistical testing


Necessary functions to run all codes are contained in util_final.R

Example simulation is performed in rawlooperd2_new.R

asdist_new.RMD shows the computations performed for the asymptotic dispersion matrix of the Dirichlet MLE. 

tablemaker_new.RMD can create all of the tables shown in the manuscript.
